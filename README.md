## TODO:

Some important things was not implemented yet, such as:

- [ ] Output the result as expected;
- [ ] Implement the Tabu search;
- [ ] A script/notebook to generate the analysis.

Some other _"not-so-important"_ things must also be done,
such as:

- [ ] A Python interface for the Lop Class;
- [ ] Analyze if we can use cuda to increase performance.
